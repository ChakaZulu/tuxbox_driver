This driver combines different connection schemes and low-level IO routines for optimized and failsafe access. With release of this driver, a new connection scheme is introduced, using PortB[16:19] pins, suitable for Philips (and Nokia) boxes, without disturbing PA[8:9], used by tts/1.

Features:
- Support for connection scheme 1 (introduced with mmc.o)
- Support for connection scheme 2 (introduced with mmc2.o)
- Support for connection scheme 4 (PB[16:19])
- Uses reado-ptimization like used in mmc2.c for all connection schemes
- Write-optimization for connection scheme 1 and 4 is about 1/3 faster (low-level part) than mmc2
- With argument opt=[0:1] (defaults to 1) optimization can be toogled on/off
- Does not use GPIOs mapped to the CPM unless forced by forcehw=1 (defaults to 0)
- Connection scheme selectable with wiringopt=[0:4], while 0 is autodetection and 3 is not supported
