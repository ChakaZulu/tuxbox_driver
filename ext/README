Extension drivers
-----------------

Exist for any functionality that seems important enough to be supported but lacks a
proper interface in any currently used API.

aviaEXT:
	For the Avia MPEG decoder, is dependent on avia_av.o
	simply do "insmod aviaEXT", there are no parameters.
	
	appears as "/dev/dbox/aviaEXT", only 2 ioctls are supported
	
	ioctl:
		AVIA_EXT_IEC_SET (int)
			1 = digital optical output (IEC) is enabled
			0 = digital optical output (IEC) is disabled (clock turned off)
			(this is an Avia600-only(!) feature)
		
		AVIA_EXT_IEC_GET (*int)
			received value reflects the settings above (0= turned off, 1 = turned on)
			(this is an Avia600-only(!) feature)

	for testing there is a tool in "/apps/tuxbox/tools/misc" called - surprise - aviaext ;)
