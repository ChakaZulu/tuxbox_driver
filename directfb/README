gtx driver for DirectFB 0.3
---------------------------

This driver currently supports RGB332 and ARGB1555 modes.

for ARGB1555 mode the alpha bit toggles between half transparence and full
opacity. 

the color key for full transparecy is currently hardcoded (0x9153), this
is the default desktop background color value in ARGB1555 mode.

you can use surface->SetColor( surface, 0x24, 0x50, 0x9f, 0xff) to set 
the color to "full transparency".
